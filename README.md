# Welcome to my 'mvn-quick-start' repository!
## RRHG 2025/10/06

This repository acts as my playground for learning more
about Maven.
Sometimes, in college, we are simply told setup our
```pom.xml``` file and run:

<code>
mvn clean install
</code>

or something similar. My intention is to learn more deeply
about Maven. Have fun :P
